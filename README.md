# Twin-Cities-DSA

For this assignment, we were tasked with building a data driven web application that uses external
    API's and local data storage to encourage interest in twining. As we know, twinning is a form of legal
    or social agreement between towns, cities and regions in geographically distinct areas to
    promote cultural and commercial ties.
